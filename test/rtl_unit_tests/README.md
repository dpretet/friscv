# RTL Unit Tests

Here the user can find the directed testcases written to
test:
- [Control Unit](./friscv_rv32i_control_unit_testbench.sv)
- [ALU](./friscv_rv32i_alu_testbench.sv)

Control unit and ALU testsuites are directed, written in
pure SystemVerilog to drive and check the expected behaviors
of these cores.
